# Modal

`ModalManager` is the main point of interaction when showing and hiding modals.

## Syntax

### With template URL
```coffeescript
ModalManager.show
  path: "/template-path"
  params:
    optional: params
  name: "class-name"
  context:
    id: 100
```

### With template string
```coffeescript
ModalManager.show
  template: "<h1>Header</h1>"
  name: "class-name"
  context:
    id: 100
```

### Showing a full page modal
**Note:** This is not ready for production launch yet. Do not use this feature
unless you are behind an Apollo related feature flag, and do not launch to public yet.
```coffeescript
ModalManager.show
  template: "<h1>Full Page Modal</h1>"
  name: "my-fullpage-modal"
  size: "fullpage"
```

### Confirm and close a modal within a controller.
```coffeescript
$scope.confirmModal = ->
  #do stuff...
  $scope.modal.confirm("yes!")
```

### Referencing `context` within a controller.
```coffeescript
angular.module("ExampleApp").controller "modalController", ($scope) ->
  localContext = $scope.modal.context # now you can use me in your controller
```

### Confirm and close a modal within a template.
```html
<div>
  <th-modal-titlebar title="Foo"></th-modal-titlebar>
  <h3>Very exciting message!</h3>
  <button ng-click="modal.confirm('Yes!')">Confirm</button>
  <button ng-click="modal.dismiss('Never!')">Cancel</button>
</div>
```

### Referencing `context` within a template.
```html
<div>
  <th-modal-titlebar title="Foo"></th-modal-titlebar>
  <h3>You are editing Item # {{modal.context.id}}</h3>
</div>
```
