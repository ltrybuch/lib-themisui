# Input

Add your input fields with a little style. Unlike `<input>`, `<th-input>` must be
explictly closed. This is a browser enforced limitation of custom elements.

## API Reference
Plenty of options can be passed into your input including.. Icons, Postfix, Prefix:

[condensed="boolean"]
- Set to `true` to reduce the height of `th-input` by 25%. Defaults to `false`.

[icons="string"]
- Any [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/ "icons!")
font can be used by just passing in the relevant name. ex: `icon="dollar"` for `'fa fa-dollar'`

[prefix="string"]
- Prepend text to the begining of your input field.

[postfix="string"]
- append text to the end of your input field.

#### HTML `<input>` attributes can be passed in like you normally would:

[name="string"]
- Property name of the form under which `th-input` is added.

[placeholder="string"]
- The placeholder attribute specifies a short hint that describes the expected value.

[type="string"]
- The type attribute specifies the type of element to display. The default type is: text.
[HTML docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input)

[min="number"]
- The min attribute specifies the minimum value for `th-input`.
[HTML docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input)

[max="number"]
- The max attribute specifies the maximum value for `th-input`.
[HTML docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input)

[ng-disabled="string"]
- Set the disabled attribute if the expression inside evaluates to truthy.

[ng-change="expression"]
- Expression to be executed when selected option changes due to user interaction
with the select element.
- This **requires** ngModel to be present.
[ng-change Angular docs](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngChange).

[ng-keypress="expression"]
-Expression to evaluate upon keypress. Event object is available as $event.

[ng-blur="expression"]
- Expression to evaluate upon blur. Event object is available as $event.

Angular's input validation attributes are all optional attributes for `<thInput>`
  - [[ng-required="string"]](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngRequired)
  - [[ng-minLength="number"]](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngMinlength)
  - [[ng-maxLength="number"]](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngMaxlength)
  - [[ng-pattern="string"]](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngPattern)
  - Although the `min` and `max` attributes are not referenced in the Angular API docs
  they DO show up in the validation object and can be tested for validity.

## Notes

- If adding an icon to your input field you *cannot* also add a prefix as they
exist in the same space.
- This component is mainly useful for text input ex: `type="text"` `type="password"`
but also works great for a file selector ex: `type="file"`
- The max and min attributes works with the following input types: number, range,
date, datetime, datetime-local, month, time and week.
