# Content Header

You use the `thContentHeader` to create a Themis 'Clio' style header bar. This header contains a title and will transclude the elements contained within it. Those elements will be right aligned.

## Usage
```
<th-content-header title="Content Header Title">
  <th-button>Transcluded Button</th-button>
</th-content-header>
```
