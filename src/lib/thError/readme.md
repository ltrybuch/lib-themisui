# `thError`

## Description

Use the `thError` component to display a stylized error message.

### Markup
```
<th-error></th-error>
```

Pass in anything inside the component tags. Everything will be transcluded. (will be effected by the same styling as default message though)

```
<th-error>transcluded message</th-error>
```
